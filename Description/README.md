# React Test



1. Create a react app using `create-react-app`
1. Create a single customizable button component with the style shown in `Step2.png` (you may use global style, css module, css-in-js, whichever you prefer. Don't be too worried about the colors (just use `grey`, `red`, `blue`, `green`, etc) and font size, but do mind the layout). Make sure that when there's no text prop being sent, the string 'Back' is displayed.
1. Produce an output as shown in `Step3.png` by using **flexbox**.
1. On refreshing the page, produce a random numbers of button, with initial value of 10, to a maximum value of 20. See `Step4.flv`
1. Upon clicking any button, add 1 to the button's value . i.e. if you click a button that contains `Red10`, it should now display `Red11`. See the start of `Step4.flv` for an example
1. Commit your code to github and send us the link.
